FLOYD'S ALGORITHM = HARE AND TORTOISE ALGORITHM = TWO POINTER APPROACH

TWO POINTER APPROACH :
		Imagine there are two runners with different speed. If they are running on a 
	straight path, the fast runner will first arrive at the destination. However, 
	if they are running on a circular track, the fast runner will catch up with the
	slow runner if they keep running.
	
	1. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will stop at the end of the linked list.
	2. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet with the slow pointer.
	
- It is a safe choice to move the slow pointer one step at a time while moving 
	the fast pointer two steps at a time. For each iteration, the fast pointer 
	will move one extra step. If the length of the cycle is M, after M iterations, 
	the fast pointer will definitely move one more cycle and catch up with the slow 
	pointer.

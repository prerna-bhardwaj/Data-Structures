Condition for a tree to be a BST : 
1. Every node has at most 2 children - left and right child
2. Left child has to be strictly < parent node
3. Right child has to be >= parent node
4. Both left and right child themselves have to be BST.

Deletion of node from binary tree : 
Node to be deleted might have : 
	1. 0 children i.e. is a leaf node
		- directly delete it
	2. 1 child - either left or right
		- delete it and replace it by its resp child
	3. 2 non-null children i.e. both left and right child
		- grab the smallest value from the right subtree and make it the new root.
